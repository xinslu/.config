# Technologies
This repo is entirely maintained by me according to my preferences, there were a lot of tools that I used and stopped that still have dotfiles on here
- WM/DE
    - bspwm, a tiling window manager with binary space partitioning policy 
    - sxhkd, hotkey daemon
    - polybar, a easy to use status bar 
    - rofi, application launcher
    - picom, compositor
    - dunst, notification daemon
- Terminal Related
    - yay, AUR helper
    - st, suckless terminal (none of that bloat)
    - zsh, z-shell (bash but better, but also slightly slower)
    - nvim, text editor
    - ranger, terminal file manager
    - neofetch, fetch script that makes me look like a haxor man
